                          I am profoundly dedicated to the quality and relevance of the modern technical education that we offer at Deogiri Institute of Engineering & Management Studies. I strongly believe that success and excellence lie in hard work and consistency that has been proved by our academic performance in University examinations.

                        </p><p>

                          One of the founding tenets of M.S.P.M. is to promote the academic interests of the students with rural background, in the context of the ever increasing competition and globalization of the technical education. DIEMS in turn, provides an enhanced global visibility to the students with a wide range of contacts and professional networking opportunities, academic scholarships, cost beneficial services, information and necessary guidance.
                        </p><p>

                          The Marathwada region was under the influence of the Nizam of Hyderabad and the people were ignored. Later on, in accordance with the linguistic policies, Maharashtra was separated and in 1959, the Marathwada Shikshan Prasarak Mandal was established at Aurangabad, the central place of the Marathwada, which was possible due to the dedicated involvement of visionaries Mr. V. R. Sawant and Mr. Vinayakrao Patil .
                        </p><p>
                          The base of the establishment was and is still the same, to provide knowledge to the poor and ignorant. The motto “Duritanche timir jawo” , “let the darkness of ignorance be driven away”, is the foundation of the institution.
                        </p><p>
                          Following the motto and its mission, the foundation lead the path of progress for the society in the region with numerous colleges, schools and various types of career oriented courses offered in them.
                        </p><p>
                          The Institute is consistently among the top institutes of Dr. B.A.M. University in examination results. The student-centric teaching learning environment, state of the art infrastructure, well-equipped laboratories, library with good number of books, experienced and dedicated team of faculties are the key features of the Institute.
